-- cis7.sh Explanation --

To avoid having to format homework each week, the script auto-formats ".txt" homework submission file so all student has to do is copy & paste program output into the file.

We were required to have all homework source code & outputs in single ".txt" file. If the output was an image it was to be submitted separately. 

For anyone that might use the script, please make it executable & and it to your PATH variable for ease of use. 

Adios.
