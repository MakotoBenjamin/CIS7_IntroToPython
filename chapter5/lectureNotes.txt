Chapter 5 Notes:

3 types of "while" loops learned

1. Counter controlled
2. Sentinel Controlled
3. Condition Controlled

Counter --> Assign a variable a number and count until that number has been reached

Sentinel --> Have a termination value and continue looping until it's entered

Condition --> Continue to loop until specific condition is met

For Loops:

- better/cleaner way of using counter controlled loops
- while loop requires counter variable to be initialized, then a condition to be met, and a loop body separated into 3 parts
- "for" loop combines all 3 into one statement

For Loop Shorthand:

- if your value starts at 0, then you do not have to include an initial value
    eg: for i in range(4) --> goes from 0 - 4 and increments by 1 each loop

For Loop Adjusting Increment:

- eg: for i in range(5,1,-1) --> decrement by 1 until 1 is reached (excludes 1)
- eg: for i in range(3,13, 2) --> increment by 2
